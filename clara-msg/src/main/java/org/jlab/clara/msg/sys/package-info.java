 * i.e. subscribers must connect to the same proxy where publishers are
 * publishing messages in order to receive them.
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.jlab.clara.msg.sys.Registrar registrar server} can be used
 * as a registration database for long-running publishers and subscribers, where
 * actors can discover other actors with the same topics of interest.
