  xMsg is a lightweight, yet full featured publish/subscribe messaging system,
  presenting asynchronous publish/subscribe inter-process communication
  protocol.
  <p>
  xMsg publisher can send messages of any topic. xMsg subscribers subscribe to
  topics of interest and provide callbacks to handle messages as they arrive,
  Neither publisher nor subscriber knows of each others existence. Thus
  publishers and subscribers are completely independent of each others.
  <p>
  xMsg stores connections in a connection pool for efficiency reasons.
  The ZMQ socket libraries is used to manage connections.
  To solve dynamic discovery problem in pub/sub environment the need of a proxy
  server is unavoidable, and the ZMQ proxy is used to connect publishers with
  subscribers.
  An in-memory registration database is also provided to register and discover
  xMsg actors by topics of interest.
  <p>
  Int short, the entire xMsg actor API consist of:
  <ul>
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#getConnection      getConnection}
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#cacheConnection    cacheConnection}
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#destroyConnection  destroyConnection}
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#publish      publish}
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#syncPublish  syncPublish}
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#subscribe    subscribe}
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#unsubscribe  unsubscribe}
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#register     register}
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#deregister   deregister}
    <li> {@link org.jlab.coda.xmsg.core.xMsg#discover     discover}
  </ul>
